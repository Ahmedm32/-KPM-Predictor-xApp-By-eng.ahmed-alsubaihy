# -KPM-Predictor-xApp-By-eng.ahmed-alsubaihy
 KPM Predictor xApp is an open-source project for O-RAN that collects real-time Key Performance Measurements (KPM), predicts Physical Resource Block (PRB) usage using a trained LSTM model, and applies RAN control decisions dynamically.  This xApp is designed to run in an O-RAN near-RT RIC setup and integrates with InfluxDB for measurement storage
